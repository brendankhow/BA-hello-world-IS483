17/5/2025 2:28,Thisisnotatrial123,Appeal for regrading of scripts,"Hi, I am in need of some urgent assistance and advise on regrading of finals scripts. 

So what happened was that I submitted a wrong answer script into my elearn at the end of my finals exam, and I only knew about this upon results release. I saw my overall grade and was shocked to see a 'C'. I know that it is the responsibility of the student to submit the correct answer scripts but because of the pressure to submit my work in time after the end of the examination, I located to the wrong subfolder in my local desktop and mistakenly submitted the wrong document. It was a grave mistake on my part but if you guys know of any channels to appeal for a regrading or what I can do to improve my chances to get a fair reassessment of my grades from the Office of Registrar, it would really help a lot for my situation.

Also, would putting the case that having a remark would possibly help me achieve a greater honor grade help in improving the odds of having a regrading? Thank you!

1. when smu says you are guaranteed a second major with no minimum requirements, how true is this? i kinda dont believe it .. surely theres some minimum gpa requirements in the first year of studies? i'm considering marketing analytics as my second major, if anyone is willing to share your views/experiences, that will be rly helpful

2. will it be difficult for me to find a generic marketing/business job in the future with a psych degree? i've talked to a few people and they keep asking if my end goal is to be a psychologist with this degree. my answer is, not really, i think i prefer getting a job in the generic business field. i dont have a dream job per se but maybe marketing might be my thing (i come from a business diploma). 

3. i've heard of some bidding system for classes but am not entirely sure what its about, can someone explain to in simpler terms? 

4. is it possible to squeeze all of my classes into some days to free up 1-2 weekdays for part time internship? if yes, any tips on that?

appreciate any help given!!

15/5/2025 11:05,hyuunkie,NTU biz or SMU IS?,"

currently i think im interested in business analytics. i like how they are able to make use of data to come up with insights and suggestions to improve business processes. both smu information systems and ntu business allows me to specialise into business analytics. 

i like how SMU info systems has higher starting pay and teaches greater in demand technical skills compared to NTU business (generally, business teaches soft skills that doesnt require a uni degree to learn but info systems is a specialised degree). but downside is, i am required to learn coding (i'm not sure if i like coding, or worse yet i'd hate doing coding). i think i am interested in coding (sounds fun on paper) but i'm not sure if i'll like doing it, especially since it mainly involves debugging codes. from my little experience of coding from 5 years ago, i found it boring when i was learning scratch in school. i am afraid that i won't be able to push through for the next few years of my life and i'll grow to resent my job (need to do some programming and coding for at least 4-6 years?). are internships at SMU IS usually for more technical roles or a good mix of biz & tech? i'm also not that great at math (my a level grade h2 math is C) and i have to compete with peers (that may be comp sci rejects?). smu already limits the number of A grades you can obtain, so i dont think i can do that well in smu IS (in terms of gpa) - i'm not sure how important is that for employers. the caveat is that i may be able to pivot out to other technical roles (eg. data analyst, software engineer) but i'm not sure if i can see myself doing those roles. i am considering to take up a second major in communication management or marketing? i may be able to do a less technical role which requires managing people & maybe marketing, after a few years of working in the IT industry. then again i heard that it is also very competitive especially since the current IT industry & market is extremely oversaturated... i'm afraid of getting overly stressed over coping w learning coding from scratch, competing w my peers & trying to balance w other commitments (eg. CCAs or internships). 


altho NTU business does provide me more flexibility in exploring other career options in the future - eg. marketing, HR, business analytics which are areas that i'm also interested in), the main factor why i want to go NTU is for the hall life. i want to have more freedom & independence for myself and try out different CCAs. however, right now i'm questioning if it's really worth it? the total school fees for ntu business (including hall) vs smu information systems, differs only by 5k (which is not a lot), with ntu being cheaper. my salary for ntu business might already be low-balled (it's definitely lower compared to NUS and SMU biz) since employers take into consideration that it is a 3 year degree programme. NTU also apparently cut short the learning in order to squeeze it into a 3 year programme, instead of the usual 4. NTU specialisation is also not in business (in fact, SMU beats it in this aspect) but rather engineering courses. and besides, will i really be able to have the time to try out all the CCAs i want to join? at the end of the day, i only have 2 years to experience hall life and i still have to prioritise my studies. it's not very realistic of me to try out a whole lot of CCAs - i still have to choose which ones to prioritise. SMU also offers CCAs but the culture may not be as strong since there is no hall.


tldr NTU business is the safer option which gives me better work life balance. SMU info systems is a high risk & high reward course for me üò≠

A bit of context, I'm currently serving my National Service and will ORD in August this year. Two years ago, I accepted SMU's Deferred Declaration Degree programme under CIS. The reserve slots I chose were Business Administration and Social Science (PPS/PLE).

At the time, I was super excited to enroll at this course since I thought it was a wonderful opportunity to be able to study a plethora of modules across schools/industries.

My aunt however was quite reserved on why I chose such a new, risky and unknown degree program. She was also wandering why I didn't just accept the safer NUS Business Admin degree instead. (Can you tell she is an NUS alumni?)

Anyways, fast forward two years and hormat senjata later, I will be enrolling come August. Current CIS students mind sharing how your experience has been so far as the inaugural batch?

13/5/2025 12:52,SnowyDusk,NUS vs SMU Econs (for Masters Abroad),"Edit: I apologise if I put the wrong flair!

Hello everyone! I just received my offer for NUS Econs so now I am facing a dilemma between NUS and SMU.

I'm going to be completely honest, I like SMU as a school more than NUS. I love the seminar-style lessons and I personally feel that having gone through the JC lecture tutorial system I'm not too fond of it. I like smaller classes and SMU is right up that alley. It is also easier for me to get there too via public transport. 

BUT my real concern is international opportunities:

- It has been a dream of mine to study abroad, especially in a top UK uni.

- I also aim to go on exchange to the UK during undergrad.

- I want to work abroad (within Europe) right after my Masters, on the global policy side of things. I do NOT plan to go on the quant-side of econs.

This is why I'm considering NUS too because from what I understand from past posts, NUS is more internationally recognised. 

But then again I also know it's useless to go NUS if I don't thrive in the lessons so... üò≠

If anyone has any experience with such exchanges and overseas applications, I'd appreciate any insights! Thank you!

1. Are there a lot of group projects? Is there going to be a group project for every module?  
  
2. What do I need to do to get class participation points? Is it hard to get class participation as someone more reserved? I don't mind talking and presenting. I am okay at presenting, but I don't know how important it is for your grade.  
  
3. Will we learn more modern frameworks? I saw that the web development modules are using PHP and Vue. Will we learn front-end frameworks like React.js or backend like Node.js?  Are we expected to know these already? What about some Microsoft frameworks like ASP.NET? 

4. How important are group mates for your group projects? I had a module in poly where we had to develop a web app for clients based on their requirements, following agile development. I won't go into detail, but I basically coded the whole app myself. So, will I be graded mostly based on my aptitude or overall based on both my and my group mates' effort and teamwork?

(Brief intro: I'm a Singapore PR, graduated with IB in high school, currently serving NS, set to start university this year)

1. Does the scholarship cover the costs for both my degrees?

If not guaranteed, does being a scholar at least grant you a better/higher chance at getting housing at SMU? (By housing, I'm referring to PSR and Campus by the assembly place (mainly PSR cuz it is closer))  
4. Terms and conditions for this scholarship online say ""scholarship will be renewed every semester upon good academic progress and good conduct"". Is there any specific GPA (or other academic/non-academic) requirements they've set in place to review ""good academic progress and good conduct""?

That's all for now, may edit this page if I have more enquiries (or just repost). Please do feel free to add on your own personal views and stuff as well, about this scholarship, SMU CS and business, if you think this offer is worth it, or rather anything at all.

7/5/2025 15:25,ctscanner222,smu pps vs ntu sociology,"hello! i recently got an offer for smu pps and ntu sociology and am trying to decide between the two -- i'm pretty sure i want to study sociology and will declare soci as my major in the 2nd year if i go to smu so i wanted to learn more about how smu soci compares with ntu soci

i saw a few different posts on this but they were mostly 4/5 years back so i was wondering if anyone could help with some qns i have

1. what is the bidding system like for soci mods? is it very competitive? 
2. im also interested to take a second major in sustainability management or sustainable societies! is it also very competitive to bid for the courses from these majors? üòÖ how is the workload like managing 2 majors?
3. how are the prof and classes like for soci/pps? what is the workload like?
4. what are some of the types of assessment for smu soci? e.g. essays, group work! if anyone knows about the types of assessments for soci in ntu as well pls lmk too! im scared that i'll be in a essay overload when it comes to finals szn... 
5. since smu's grading and honours system is different from that of ntu and nus and is harder to score, i was wondering if its less common for people to get summa cum laude or magna cum laude? 
6. smu environment! i realised that i dont hear much/see a lot of my seniors post about smu school events and wanted to know more about sch spirit and what smu students are like üôè do a lot of students join clubs and ccas? and is joining one a big part of smu culture? im trying to understand abit more about smu culture since smu's campus is in the city which makes the whole school feel a little disconnected and not like a more traditional uni (i did get a good vibe when i went for the open houses tho! just not sure what people do after classes and everything else )
7. also i dont mean anything but im genuinely curious on whether or not course igp matters üò≠üò≠ because people tend to use it as a benchmark for courses, and those that ""better"" and harder to get into have higher igp... 

overall i am quite interested to attend smu but just abit scared of the scoring system esp since i want to go for a mid-term scholarship! and i'm also not sure if i'll be able to get the mods i want... but smu's overseas exchange and smaller class size is also smth that i prefer over ntu so im conflicted... 

will be grateful if anyone could provide their 2 cents or any advice or even just their experience studying in smu pps so i could learn abit more, thank you so much!!

2. i know that you kind of have points(?) to bid for modules, is it the same for law, or is it more fixed mods for y1 like nus law? 

3. reading and recess weeks! i saw that the academic calender only has recess week but my senior in IS seemed to have a reading week?? also generally for law how many weeks does one have after content is finished before finals startü´†

4. how are the profs/classes in general like! since smu only does tutorials and no lectures? does that mean all readings etc have to completed before class and no/minimal guidance on that.

5. I've heard about the grading system and there is tough bell curve for law, like only 5 A per class(correct me if I'm wrong) and that A/A+ gives a big boost?  can someone clarify how the system works... and what is avg for law!

6/5/2025 13:42,ExpensiveAide2690,Can't decide between SMU CS and NUS CHS,"For context:
- completed a levels in 2023 and took a gap year in 2024, as a break from jc to explore my opportunities and career options 
- applied and got accepted into NUS CHS(Political Science) in 2024, and then reapplied and was offered SMU CS this year
-  h2 math was my favourite subject in jc, but im not sure if I would enjoy uni maths - particularly not fond of combinatorics or statistics, only calculus 


Currently having trouble reconciling my interest to decide what I would truly enjoy pursuing in uni, since...

- I have always wanted to create my own games or apps/software: Thus, leading to my interest in applying for SMU CS for its track(specialisation) in software systems (that includes exploration of computer graphics)(as well as exploring some mods for SMU IS's degree programme)
    - However, I do have doubts on my post-grad career options, due to the current state of tech and tech-adjacent industries: oversaturated, layoffs, increasing use of AI etc...
     - But, I do acknowledge that alot of things can change in 4-5years after I grad

- I have also been interested in politics and economic policy, related to concepts like meritocracy and equity/equality in opportunities: Leading to my interest in NUS political science and/or NUS Econs(with its spec. in applied and policy econs)
    - Also thought about taking a ('complementary')second major in Data Science and Analytics from NUS to acquire some quantitative/hard skills, but unsure if I would survive the vast amounts of statistics involved üò≠(although econs and econometrics does have its fair share of math itself)
    - I do recognise that SMU guarantees second majors, so I could possibly take a second major in political science from SMU as well 

Overall, 
 - One major aspect of NUS that I favour over SMU is the presence of hall/house/RCs, since I've always wanted a space of my own.    
    - However, I do recognise that SMU has guaranteed overseas opportunities that may offer similar types of accommodations that provide the same sense of belonging to a 'community' 
- Additionally, NUS CHS has the flexibility to declare majors up to 5th sem should I still be undecided on my degree programme, 
    - However CHS also has 13 common curriculum mods making up 1/3 of the degree, which I find abit ridiculous
- I am also thinking about keeping my options open for local/overseas post-grad education masters, and working and possibly living overseas

5/5/2025 5:43,Pure_Recognition_533,tough decisions: passion or pragmatism,"(tl;dr: year 1 student at a local uni, stuck in a course I have no passion for ‚Äî chose it for job prospects which i realised was a bad idea. also realised I couldn‚Äôt keep up with peers in computing and decided to chase my true interest ‚Äî law. i reapplied and got into SMU Law (waiting on NUS), but now facing a $52K tuition fee shortfall due to MOE‚Äôs grant cap (already used up 2 semesters in current course). from a middle-low income family and really don‚Äôt want to burden my parents. looking for advice on how to finance the last 2 semesters (external scholarships, bursaries, loans, etc.) or if anyone has gone through something similar. appreciate any help!)

so for a bit of context i am currently a year 1 studying at a local u, one year into the course i honestly have zero passion in what i‚Äôm doing esp bcz i chose this course based on the monetary prospects (it is the one of the highest paying ones based on the university ges survey lol so yall prolly know what it is) and also because of sentiment among my peers and family about how ‚Äútech is the future‚Äù and everyone really wanted a piece of pie at it etc etc

the trigger point came during this semester when i started getting straight 0s for a component of my mod. thats when i realised i really lacked motivation and passion in seeing it through bcs i never genuinely took interest in computing like how other people started to grind leetcode n shit before uni even started and i feared that if i continue to go on i would suffer even more because around me are all driven people who genuinely like computing or people who are slowly getting the hang of it while i was the kid that never even touched coding in their life before uni even started so i realised how terribly i am lacking behind and i cant see myself through this rat race of competing for a piece of pie in the tech industry especially when its already known that the hype train is dying down.

so what are my passions? before this i was interested in law bcs im genuinely interested in the societal structures and policies that shape up our society and i think law is a reflection of our belief systems and i wanted to be part of it since i started researching about it a few years back while applying for unis. while i applied for law school, i was waitlisted at all of them bcs i genuinely just had shit luck w the profs who shot down my opinions (lol) and i just didnt know how to present myself properly through video interview (bcs it was covid back then)

so ukw this year i decided to fuck it, took a gamble and tried for law again in the regular admissions cycle. i breezed through the writing tests and i had an amazing interview w the profs this time round, and i got in to SMU Law. currently im still waiting for NUS but i‚Äôm not sure if ill make the cut for it because the interview was pretty meh and i didnt felt as connected as i were with the SMU law profs.

so great right? i get a second chance at my undergrad. and in a school and a degree i always wanted to pursue. but the caveat? as i wasted two semesters of tuition grant in my previous course, the total semesters im eligible for tuition grant, and therefore subsidised tuition fees is only 6 semesters. ü•≤ i was already acutely aware of this before applying, but when i was confronted with the facts again and the amount i have to pay for the last year in law school, my heart honestly skipped a beat. $52000. and i will not be eligible for any financial aid or scholarships administered by MOE or by SMU during these last two sems bcs this is the tuition grant policy outlined by the govt. dammit. this part i honestly forgot and i kept thinking i could compensate by applying for mid term scholarships or bursary awards if i study my hardest in law school. but i cant even do that now as they said they wont entertain any appeals.

well yes, while i really want to study law and this is a course i really have the motivation to do well in bcs i genuinely will enjoy the academic rigour and the intellectual enrichment (lets not talk abt the large proportion of lawyers losing passion on the job rn tho LOL trying rlly hard to not think abt this), $52000 is not a small sum for my family to afford and we are a middle-low income family (my father is abt to retire). while i have talked to my parents abt reapplying to law, i have not spoken abt this issue to them bcs im honestly scared that they will tell me to just give up or don‚Äôt go for it anymore. while i know my parents technically could afford the sum, i really don‚Äôt want to burden them with such a huge sum of money especially at their old age. so now, i have two options (technically 3 if i get NUS but similar issues again since i can barely transfer any credits over probably) but basically to choose passion at a financial COST or pragmatism at the COST of my mental health. i honestly already made up my mind before this and i was starting to prepare to withdraw from my school as soon as I was going to receive all of my outcomes but the amount is genuinely a bit daunting.

thank you to everyone who really read all the way to the bottom of this thread i know its like grandfather story all and i am typing this at 4am rn bcs this problem is all i can think about in the past week bcs it really concerns my own future. but i wish to reach out to all of you guys who may have been through similar situations (idk if theres any lmao) and to know if theres any other options to finance the $52k school fee (on top of the existing year 1-3 subsidised fees ‚Äî which are def much more manageable for me and my family bcs these are eligible for financial aid and scholarships) from EXTERNAL sources (aka non MOE or university options) like loans or any sort of scheme that could potentially alleviate part of the burden should i take this on bcs this is something i genuinely do not know where to find information online from bcs theres so few people transferring universities üò≠ honestly think i fell through policy loophole or sumn bcs wthell sia but i gets the equal allocation of resources idea la‚Ä¶..",Local Undergraduate Admissions,16,11,https://reddit.com/r/SMU_Singapore/comments/1kf4949/tough_decisions_passion_or_pragmatism/

22/4/2025 11:08,rayraybites,SMU application process to the MPA programme as a foreign student,"This is a post sharing my experience applying for the programme so that other applicants don't have to repeat the same loops I went through.

**Application process overview**  
Estimated 4 weeks from the start of the application to the end (offer letter acceptance).

***Steps*** are as follows:

1. Application (requires a resume, two referees, an essay and a personal statement)
2. Admission test aka SMUAT (if you didn't do GMAT or GRE, may not be required of local applicants)
3. Admission interview
4. Offer letter, if accepted

***Fees:***  
‚Ä¢  S$100 for applicaiton  
‚Ä¢  S$125 for each attempt of SMUAT, up to 3 attempts allowed

Relevant ***People*** you may want to look into:  
‚Ä¢  Monica Li (Graduate Programmes & Professional Development Office, for MPA and MSA)  
‚Ä¢  Ruben Dsilva (Manager, Marketing & Admissions)  
‚Ä¢  Prasart JONGJAROENKAMOL (MPA Programme Co-Director)  
‚Ä¢  WANG Jiwei (MPA Programme Director)

**What I used to learn more about the programme**  
*Website*  
A lot of their programme details are already there. Note that there is a pretty extensive FAQ section there (so that you don't accidentally ask repetitive questions like I did).

*1-on-1 consultation*  
The programme officer, Monica Li, ran me through what can mostly be found on the website and brochure, the history of SMU and campuses, and the admission process.

*Email with Monica Li*  
My dad wanted to know the employment statistics specific to new graduates, so I sent a question regarding that plus some other things about the class size. Monica replied that the detailed statistics are not shared publicly and declined to respond to the other question at all. What I learned from this: Monica isn't very responsive over email, if you have detailed questions, make sure to ask them during the consultation.

*Uni-buddy (chat with ambassadors)*  
Chatted with three ambassadors, one from the MSA programme (which I was initially more interested in), and from MPA, and one from MAF (because he was the same nationality as I am). The MSA ambassador never responded.

The MPA ambassador explained many things proactively:  
‚Ä¢  why there were so many students from mainland China in MPA -- SMU is partnered with some of the unis in China where many students could do a diploma before transferring to SMU.  
‚Ä¢  why there are more students in MPA than MSA  
‚Ä¢  how he prepared for the admission test -- he got practice exams from his seniors and prepared for around two weeks

Met with the MAF ambassador who explained the application process and admission test in a bit more detail.

**Application**  
*Resume*  
I used a standard black and white one without pictures mostly detailing my academic history.

*Personal Statement (500-600 words)*  
Looked at the guidance and samples on Purdue owl.

*Essay (500-600 words)*  
Topics (not exact wording):

1. Your greatest weakness and how you've tried to overcome it
2. Achievements, strengths, and talents not reflected on your academic history and resume
3. Greatest ethical dilemma you've faced and how your input helped resolve it

I chose topic 1. The personal statement and essay actually quite a few days (of self-doubt and existential crisis) to complete. I wrote them myself and refined them for clarity, tone, and structure using Copilot and ChatGPT. Used the ChatGPT AI Detector to make sure it isn't flagged as AI-written.

**Admission test**  
The current admission tests are actually the short form, formerly known as 'cut-e' tests, conducted by Aon. The three SMU uses are:

1. Numerical reasoning
2. Verbal reasoning
3. Inductive reasoning (scales clx)

There are two guides created by SMU that can be found on google (which are also what the admissions office will provide if you ask them).

1. [SMU Admission Test Factsheet\_0.pdf](https://masters.smu.edu.sg/sites/masters.smu.edu.sg/files/PDF%20docs/SMU%20Admission%20Test%20Factsheet_0.pdf)
2. [Candidate Guide on Aon Assessments for SMU Admissions Test](https://masters.smu.edu.sg/sites/masters.smu.edu.sg/files/PDF%20docs/SMU%20candidate%20guide_refreshed.pdf)

Aon has guides too:

1. [Practice-Tasks\_verbal.pdf](https://assessment.aon.com/aon.assessment/media/files/factsheets/Practice-Tasks_verbal.pdf)
2. [Practice-Tasks\_numerical.pdf](https://assessment.aon.com/aon.assessment/media/files/factsheets/Practice-Tasks_numerical.pdf)
3. [Prepare for your Online Assessment | Aon](https://www.aon.com/en/capabilities/talent-and-rewards/prepare-for-your-online-assessment)

The tests are reasonably easy. Will requires not jumping to immediate conclusions without clearly stated linkages and time-management. I passed with 63 on the first attempt. I also paid for an attempt on the day I submitted the application and took the test the day the sent the link, which was the following day.

**Admission interview**  
I think I've messed this one up.

Three people were present at the interview:  
‚Ä¢  Monica Li  
‚Ä¢  Ruben Dsilva  
‚Ä¢  Prasart JONGJAROENKAMOL (not sure, I was too nervous to remember his name)

It seemed like Monica was there just for introductions and facilitating the interview (inviting candidates into the zoom meeting and such). Mr Ruben turned his camera off midway and did not interact with me. It was Mr Prasart who was asking the questions.

At the start of the interview, I was told to introduce myself. I wasn't sure how to do that although SMU does have a guide ([What to expect during the SMU Accounting Masters' Interview Session | School of Accountancy](https://accountancy.smu.edu.sg/news/what-expect-during-smu-accounting-masters-interview-session)) and I did some preparation based on it. I thought they would ask more questions so I stopped at what I prepared for the 'what' part.

After this, they asked more personalized questions:

1. How long I've been in Singapore
2. Where my family was and whether they were okay (because of a recent earthquake)
3. Explanation of the timeframes for my studies and where I did them (because I did ACCA and their BSc Applied Accounting)
4. What industry I intended to work it. I answered that I didn't have an industry in mind, but I was interested in things related to sustainability and ESG reporting. He asked why was interested in it to follow that up.

The interview session ended ahead of time (couldn't have taken more than 8 minutes).

My takeaway was that I should've done more to prepare and thought about my answers, my goals, and the actual whys behind them in more detail. I probably came across as someone who was interested in going into audit just because 'everyone else did that', but not sure where else to take my career from there.

If I could do the interview again, I would:  
‚Ä¢  Do a fuller introduction of myself with all the who what and whys, with emphasis on what I can contribute, timed to around 5 minutes  
‚Ä¢  Show more conviction in what I believed myself to be capable of and my values  
‚Ä¢  If I really didn't know where to take my career still, would answer that one of the reasons for applying to SMU is to get the chance to explore this

**Conclusion/Impression so far**  
I'll update this post again when I get either my offer letter or rejection letter. But for now, I think even if I don't get accepted into the programme, this was a valuable experience for me. It was reassuring to know that what I've done so far is enough to be shortlisted for a masters programme at SMU which I've been told for the longest time is hard to get into.

Update: I got the offer letter the day after the interview -- it only took 7 days from the day I sent in the application to the offer letter.",Postgraduate Programmes,9,0,https://reddit.com/r/SMU_Singapore/comments/1k53leh/smu_application_process_to_the_mpa_programme_as_a/

I am currently applying for MAF program for Aug 2025 intake. 

I have seen many posts regarding MAF or SMU Masters in general (the good, the bad, competitiveness, etc) but I have yet gained a clear view on MAF's employability especially in the current work ecosystem in Singapore, particularly in the field of Banking, Finance, Investment, and other related institutions.

To gain a concrete view, I would like to receive some real examples of MAF graduates that you know of (or yourself) that have been recently hired in those areas. Or maybe MAF graduates that you have met and currently are thriving in those sectors. Or you could just share any kinds of experience and knowledge about the alumni of MAF in general.

Please do share! Thanks!

14/4/2025 18:55,MoneyPlenty3556,Why do some people seem so much smarter and able to effortlessly maintain 4.0+ GPA? Is it possible to significantly improve myself? How?,"Over the years, I‚Äôve encountered certain individuals who effortlessly breeze through every class they attend. They exude an aura of intelligence, effortlessly grasp key concepts and quickly absorb vast amounts of information. I‚Äôve even created/studied from the same notes as some of them due to being in their study group, and yet they consistently achieve far superior grades. And from what I‚Äôve gathered, effort actually points in the opposite direction as, for example, I know some of them spend their time gaming while I‚Äôm working like a cow to the point of having daily headaches, trying to scrape by with a B+. 

I‚Äôve always attributed their success to natural intelligence, wishing I possessed those abilities. But recently I‚Äôve been more curious about finding out the truth. 

Are the top students mostly just naturally gifted, or is there something they do that sets them apart e.g.  habits, behaviors, interests, attitudes, or personality traits? What actions can I take to improve my academic performance in a meaningful manner, or should I accept the notion that some individuals possess inherent intelligence that cannot really be trained?

Unable to declare major from end Mar till end of Term 2 is a significant portion of Term 2. Yet, we were informed that we had till end of Term 2 to declare our Major.

Help.

30/3/2025 5:39,Dull_Lavishness4084,SMU Masters is a Joke.,"I'm an international student who came to SMU with high hopes but on god this place has made me question life.

Mine and our another similar program's batches are atleast 95% Chinese, with the rest being Indonesians, Indians, Malaysians, and Singaporeans. With such low diversity, people just don't talk in English. Every group chat is also in Mandarin, with the rest of us having to scramble to translate and understand whatever is going on. It becomes very alienating. 

A big chunk of our batch doesn't understand English which then made me question them, how did you get through the interview? They replied ""Our interviews were in Mandarin."" HOW IS THIS FAIR?! Why are other students from non-English speaking countries required to sit through English tests and English interviews while the whole process is a lot simpler for others? Isn't this interviewer's bias?

The classes are barely interactive and fairly so because 80% of the people don't speak English. Almost every prof then goes through the same old technique of monotonously reading their slides for 3 hours straight. A long while ago, I got assigned a prof who couldn't understand spoken English properly which made it a nightmare to ask questions and clarify doubts. How are we even supposed to cope? Lack of language parity makes group projects a nightmare too.

The career cell has been utterly useless for atleast me and my batch. From a pool of 80, maybe 5 have gotten internships. In another programme, again maybe 5-6 people have bagged internships out of a pool of 150+ students. I assume the reasoning behind this to be that these programs have 90-95% international students who are always gonna have issues with securing jobs in Singapore but even then, the number is far too low.

All this time being here has made me feel helpless and lonely and at this point I can't even think of any other way to improve this situation rather than dejectedly going back home once I graduate.",Rant,274,64,https://reddit.com/r/SMU_Singapore/comments/1jn5tcz/smu_masters_is_a_joke/

27/3/2025 10:43,starsyay,International student interested in Masters in Economics,"Hi! I'm a foreigner interested in applying for SMU's Masters in Economics (MSE) program. I'm specifically looking at their regular pathway because I don't have a background in econ (my work experience has been in education as a teacher and as a policy researcher). Some questions I have:

1. I'm a bit worried about how intensive the math will be in the program. I've read a few posts on here and on SGExams about SMU's undergrad econ program, and the consensus seems to be that there is a lot of math. Is there anyone with experience with the MSE who can talk a little about how math-heavy the program is, particularly for someone without a background in econ? For reference, while I do have experience with the basics (like algebra, trig, geom, some statistics) I've never taken a calculus class or an advanced stat class, and I have no experience whatsoever with mathematical models or anything similar. While I am willing to work very hard now and after admissions (if I am accepted) to build my mathematical foundation, how much of a learning gap am I facing here? And in your opinion is this gap bridgeable? 
2. How easy is it to make friends in postgraduate programs in SMU? I'm pretty outgoing and social and I would be kind of miserable without friends in the program. 
3. For anyone with experience/knowledge on SMU's campus, how wheelchair accessible is it? I'm a permanent wheelchair user so accessibility is really important to me. I've heard that NUS for instance is quite hilly and not very accessible so that's a consideration for me. 
4. I don't plan on working in Singapore after the MSE, I'm more likely going to find work in my country (Philippines). I hear SMU is quite supportive in terms of alumni network and career opportunities. I'm personally planning to make a career pivot to policy work (which is why I'm considering a postgrad degree). Would an MSE from SMU be useful in making that pivot especially in landing a job? 
5. Is it better to take the GRE/GMAT or the SMUAT? I'm a bit scared to take the SMUAT because from the Candidate Guide online it looks like speed is a huge factor, and I'm not that fast when taking tests.

I got rejected from Law, sadly, but it seems this is also an interesting course. I have questions about the program.

1. Is the law modules and computing modules exactly the same as that in the Computer Engineering and Law undergraduate program? A look at the brochure seems to suggest so, but I wonder if it is perhaps reduced content or something?

2. Will I have to take modules with students from Law and Computer Engineering? 

3. I don‚Äôt have much (if any) computing knowledge. Do I face a massive learning curve when it comes to the Computing side? I have some worries about this. If there is a learning curve, how do I mitigate it before I get in? (I have 2 years on NS‚Ä¶)

4. Are there still opportunities for student exchanges? It seems a bit odd considering that I am not taking purely Law or Computer Engineering (if I accept the offer after Discovery Day).

5. What are the career prospects for this BSc program? What do these people work as? Is the job market tight and competitive?

6. I know that I can‚Äôt become a lawyer with this BSc only, but I need to go through JD? Ultimately, I am inclined to become a lawyer.

I just received an email saying that I was shortlisted for a virtual admission interview that will take place at the end of March.

As per my current knowledge, I was actually expecting to either:
1)  receive a DD letter shortly after admissions close or 

2) not receive a DD letter after admissions close on 19 April 2025, and then either get an interview slot or not get an interview slot.

So I'm kinda curious why they offer me an admissions interview despite my 87.5rp but before the admissions close. Not sure if this is a scholarship interview (I did apply) but the email doesn't say scholarship at all, just says ""admission interview"".

Has anyone been in this situation before?

	4.	How is the cost of living for students? Any budgeting tips for food, transport, and other expenses?

I haven‚Äôt been to Asia before, so I‚Äôd love to make the most of the experience, travel around, and meet new people. But the high cost of housing makes me wonder if I should consider other options.

so I recently got back my A-levels results and sadly underperformed scoring a 74.25rp + hmt. :((

I took BCM/e and got CCC/AA(gp)B(pw)

rlly clueless abt uni apps/ courses rn so rlly appreciate if any snrs could help!

# SMU:

just a little background info, im interested in pursuing either biz, social sci, econs or accounting

***1. Ranking of choices***

since i heard that ranking somewhat matters during applications I wanted to know if i would lower my chances of getting into social sci/ econs, accting etc with a lower igp of 75 rp (0.75rp diff) if i put biz as my first choice which has a higher igp of 77.5 rp (3.25rp diff), I genuinely dont mind getting into any of my choices but would prefer biz management just because i dont rlly know what i want to pursue in the future. (i think its easier to find a job?)

***2. Diff between SMU PPS and SMU PLE***

i looked through the modules and found them rlly interesting! personally leaning towards PLE more.

* does PLE have higher rp requirements than PPS (higher than the stated ""75rp"")considering that it's a multidisciplinary course?
* what was the lowest rp accepted into PLE in the previous years? (I want to know my chances of getting in bcos im afraid that it will again, lower my chances of getting into my other lower ranked choices)
* would PLE open me to more job opportunities in comparison to PPS? or are they quite similar?
* the website stated that PLE requires strong english and maths foundation and im worried that i would be at a disadvantage due to my C in h2 maths (i got b3 for both amaths and emaths for Os)
* how is the curriculum like? what abt the exams and assignments?
* would it be tough for me considering i was from sci stream?

24/2/2025 8:27,SeaworthinessFirm820,qns about cs,"hi i'm considering joining smu cs programme. my interests actually lie more towards science but i really really prefer smu's seminar based teaching style and closer knit community so i am now looking at CS as an option. i am somewhat interested in coding but i have absolutely zero background knowledge on it. i would appreciate any seniors sharing their experiences with me!

1. how do you know if you should pursue CS? is it because you like math? personally, i did struggle quite a bit for math my entire life, but i do enjoy problem solving which i think is a huge part of CS?

2. any of you regret joining? ik the job market is really bad rn but idk if it will change in 5-10 years time after i graduate. is there a possibility where a CS degree may become obsolete due to lower barriers to entry/replacement by AI?

3. what are the majority of your tests and assignments like? is it like math qns? or essays/projects?

4. would you say that being a good comp scientist involves having better hard skills and knowledge? what differentiates 2 prospective employees and who would have a better edge in the workforce?

5. since all students are required to take the smu core mods, what are the other mods like? bc i'm actually not quite interested in econs related stuff so yeah

6. how would i know if i will enjoy learning CS? should i try to learn coding myself first or smth üò≠

7. what's your schedule like? how many hours do you spend on assignments and studying? if you get stuck, do you have to be very independent and source for info online?

8. how would you compare the workload to a levels?

tbh what's most attractive to me about CS is obviously the pay, it's something that i can see myself doing (i do not have any interest in finance/econs, and also science degrees are not lucrative at all so yeah), and i think a CS degree opens up a lot of career paths and good progression.

22/2/2025 10:21,FurballTheHammy,Does anyone feel that more mods should have their CU weightage changed?,"SMU has 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 CU mods but most of the non 1 CU mods are all limited to law. And this never really made sense to me.

Anyone who has taken a couple of mods in SMU will have realised that some mods take a laughably low amount of time and effort as opposed to others. Look at mods like BQ, E&S, Management Comms and certain entry level mods.

You can‚Äôt tell me with a straight face that a mod like Math for Economics, Probability Theory & Applications, Stochastic Finance, Advanced Microeconomics and etc take the same amount of hours to master said content as the above. Those mods are notorious for their time sinks in order to get good at it, it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúattend class and study 1 hour a week‚Äù and I‚Äôll at least get a B type of mod. These mods will genuinely threaten you with a C if you don‚Äôt take them seriously.

This isn‚Äôt just in Y1 either, SOE students will know how certain Econ core mods like EDA are so light compared to other Econ core mods like your Microeconomics1-2 + Macroeconomics1-2. 

All I honestly ask is for mods to have their weightage adjusted. I enjoy taking these ‚Äúharder‚Äù more ‚Äúquantitative‚Äù mods but not only is it harder to get a good grade for those, it‚Äôs a downright insult to go ‚Äúyea, your Risk Theory & Loss models mod has as much content as Econ Dev in Asia‚Ä¶‚Äù 

I‚Äôd like to take 4 hard mods a sem but when I see other fluffier mods like Strat Thinking, EOG, etc mods that can easily be done with 5 or even 6 mods a sem. I can‚Äôt help but just feel like I‚Äôm being punished to learn more or challenge myself.

And also I find it laughable that Master level econ mods that are open to undergraduate Quant Econ students are worth 1CU. Yea man, Math for Econ Dynamics which is Math for Econ but at a masters level is as content heavy as‚Ä¶ Big Questions. Cool story bro. 

At least adjust the notoriously hard mods which even the profs acknowledge to be hard to a fairer CU weightage to reflect the quantity of work and hours to master said mod. I‚Äôm not asking for 2.0CU just 1.25CU will make it less punishing to do 4 hard mods and I‚Äôll still get it counted as 5 CU overall in a sem. I don‚Äôt mind attending more hours of classes, in fact most of the mods I listed above will benefit students with an extra 25-50% class hours. This is coming from a TA who even teaches those mods, the prof tends to rush through parts of those mods because there‚Äôs not enough time and you‚Äôre then asked to pick up the slack yourself. 

NUS and NTU at least makes an attempt to balance out mods. 

Haiz, just tilted about this and wanted to rant. Sorry.

2. does smu take into consideration at all any leadership & work stuff (i‚Äôve done intern and am part time tutoring) / holistic achievements

3. suspect biz sound far-fetched for me atp‚Ä¶ will ranking another major as my first choice - one with an igp closer to my cgpa increase my chances for admission?

I've just been thinking super hard between IS and CS, im not sure if CS is only limited to cybersecurity, software systems and AI, cos i think im only interested in the AI part of CS and not really the rest, IS lets you take a dual track in IoT too, which im a bit more interested in than CyberSec, but i feel like IS would be more of how to use AI in business? not really creating the AI? or am i wrong?

As an international student who'll be studying in SG, It'll be really helpful if y'all could help me answer a few questions -:

1. Is SMU's MQF program worth it, in terms of curriculum and Employment ( especially for a fesher international student)
2. Which program out of the three is better and why?
3. is it better to apply after some workex, I currently have a actuarial offer at hand, so should I apply after maybe 1-2 years of work, or if I even apply today, will I be able to find employment opportunity in a Quant based role .
4. is it worth to apply to such programs in SG, or US is the only good destination to do these courses, due to decent amt of Quant roles there.

15/1/2025 12:57,Titsypoop,Question on Grad requirements ,"Hi guys, I have some questions regarding my current situation and whether or not there is chance for graduating on time. (Currently y4s2)

For context, I currently am pursuing a double major in entrep and strategy, and I have recently came back from my exchange. Due to poor alignment of schedule and planning on my end, I will be doing a 4 day work week internship, meaning I only have 1 day for school. 

The current problem is that I am currently clearing capstone which I wouldn't try to drop and rebid, plus since most of the slots are already taken up I believe it might be difficult to get the remaining slot. I only need to clear 2 main mods, one being capstone and the other being my entrep major core, which has very limited classes on only specific timeslots. Currently, the timing of the classes to clear this basket is only on Mon/Wed afternoon which would then affect my work arrangement of 4 day work week because capstone is on Tuesday afternoon.

So here's the question.

1. Are there any alternatives that I can explore, for instance appealing to up a module from an elective to the one in the core major basket and using another extra elective that I have to cover that CU requirement. Or if there have been some form of exception made in the past.

2. If I were to drop my entrep major, would there be any issues? Ie if strategy is the sole major, do I have to take more mods or will the entrep mods just shift itself into the free electives section? 

3. If I were to grad late (extend for another sem), how much is the cost for a singular mod, and if it's advised?

Any advise would be greatly appreciated. 
Totally understand that it's a massive oversight and poor planning on my end, will reflect.

Also if anyone wants to know more ABT exchange or entrep/strat mod feels free to PM me will help in my best capacity.",Other,2,4,https://reddit.com/r/SMU_Singapore/comments/1i1wsoy/question_on_grad_requirements/

2. do u foresee the job market incorporating these 2 fields in sg?

I just finished Y2S1, m an international student, I had FA in Y1S1 and asked for my prof if I can be his TA, he told that he teaches only 1 sem so to kindly email in ending July. I then too emailed him in mid-May for the position to which his response was that the positions are full. Context: I used to Class part good and got an A+ in the mod. 

Then in Y1S2, I again approached my EnS prof for being her TA but again got to know that she teaches only one sem. This time I had emailed her, again context: I did class part and went for her consultations, she knew me properly and got A+ in the subject. 
So her email told to email her again for this in end of Decembers but just to avoid any problem I emailed her in mid-Decembers which was a few days ago to which her response was the same that the TA positions are filled. 

üò≠üò≠ I am very confused on what am I doing wrong? The reason I asked these two profs particularly was cause the TAs are not expected to stay in the class but only check assignments. I emailed them b4 they had asked me to as I get there wud be more demand but now my question is when exactly sud I had emailed them? ?? 

I have been constantly participating in both the classes to the point that after exams my EnS prof had come to me and even asked how was my exam... n have never been rude or misbehaved of any kind.

From adjusting to the pace of lectures to scrambling for additional practises, it‚Äôs definitely been a learning curve. I don‚Äôt really know seniors who have taken mods under my Profs, but my friends had. I felt somewhat at a disadvantaged but thankfully my friends were kind enough to share them with me! I wish I had the same access to resources though.¬†

Class part has been challenging ngl. For this one mod, my prof groups us in different tiers for CP which will be released during recess week for us to know where we stand. I was in the top tier so it was quite a shock for me when I found out I only got B for CP overall‚Ä¶. I speak more than once every lesson though. Not sure how else I should CP already.¬†

While there‚Äôs no point worrying about bellcurve, I‚Äôm really distraught at how B+ is 3.3 while A- is 3.7. The raw score for B+ is 77-79 and A- is 80-82, but A- gives you so much more opportunities, even putting you on Deans List. This just makes everything even more competitive. Sigh.

I recently scored **655 on the GMAT**, and I‚Äôm exploring my options for pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Applied Finance. I‚Äôm particularly interested in the program offered by **Singapore Management University (SMU)**.

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of my profile:

* **Work Experience**: 3 years as an IT professional, primarily working on application development and process automation.
* **Technical Skills**: Proficient in Python, which I believe could be useful in financial modeling or analytics roles.
* **Additional Experience**: 6 months in sales, which has given me exposure to client management and communication.

I‚Äôm passionate about transitioning into the financial sector and taking up roles like investment analysis, risk management, or corporate finance. My lack of direct finance-related experience is a concern, but I‚Äôm eager to learn and willing to invest time in building the necessary skills.

# My Questions:

1. **Is my GMAT score competitive for SMU‚Äôs Applied Finance program?**
2. **How does the program prepare students for transitioning from non-finance backgrounds into the financial sector?**
3. **What is the reputation of SMU‚Äôs Applied Finance program in the industry, particularly for roles in Singapore and Asia-Pacific?**
4. **Are there specific aspects of my profile (e.g., Python expertise or sales experience) that could help strengthen my application?**

I would greatly appreciate insights from anyone familiar with SMU or who has undergone a similar career transition. Any tips on improving my application or general advice about the program would also be highly valuable.

Life rn is pretty boring NGL and things are very repetitive to the point that I don't think much anymore. I have a few questions and was wondering if any kind souls or people who have gone through my experiences will be able to help answer :D. 

1) How do you guys prepare for University

This is one point I am particularly worried about as I am scared that I would forget everything I have learnt in Poly after I come out from NS since I have not had to chance to apply/use any of the things I learnt, I'm worried that I would not be able to keep up with the curriculum after I come out from NS. Is there any tips on how to adjust better/prepare for uni while in NS? 

  
2) Lee Kong Chian Scholars Programme 

It is my understanding that to maintain this scholarship, a GPA of at least 3.4 has to be maintained, can any LKC scholars tell me how strict they are with those criteria? Will there be a case-by-case basis for deciding whether to drop you from the scholarship? EG: They see you are trying your best, so they will give you a chance and try to help you. Or will they drop you immediately the moment your GPA drops below 3.4.

3. Specializing in Business Analytics is what i envisioning myself from doing now. Do i have to take a business degree to be more recognized in a financial field or is a IS degree just as fine or even better?
